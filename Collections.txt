1) java.util.Collection
java.util.List
java.util.Set
java.util.Enumeration
java.util.Vector
java.util.ArrayList
java.util.LinkedList


e.deepclone: It will retrevie the data what ever we need.
e.shallowCloning: It will retrevie all data in the object.

Linked: FirstELemnt is head.-> It is perfromance orianted because it will add objects easily and remove objects easily.

Peek()->
Pool()->

2) Wrapper classes are Primitive data types which is used as a objects.

Two objects cannot be added. Two integers cab be added.

3) Autoboxing:

It will convert object to primitive data type.

Ex: Int a=10;
int b=20;
obj=b; // AutoBoxing ------------------New feature

Integer obj= new Integer(b); --------------- Old feature 1.4
s.o.p("k");

4)
Enhanced for loop:

 for(int k: a) -> No need of index
   (:-> In the place of a we can use list, set)
{
 s.o.p("k");
}


5) Stactic variables can be accessed using class names.


To use static variables and method we can use directly "import static com.Veritis.CollectionDemo.Constants".

Constants-> Class name;

6) Variable arguments:

we can call many number of arguments instead of method overloading. That means calling add method with multiple parameters if use below concept we can call only once.

int add(int... a)
{
	int sum=o;
	for(int k; a)
		{
			sum = sum+k;
		}
	return k;
}

7) Vector: If capacity is grown it will not reduce.

example shown in class.

Size : It will tell the real size.
Capacity : It will give the actual capacity of the vector.

For Example: He can eat 10 idlis -> It is capacity.
 But he ate only 3 idlis -> It is size.

8) Collection is a interface.
   Collections is a class.

9)
HashSet:

It will be used when we need retreive fast for a element.

It is the fastest searching algorithm.

Hash set will not allow duplicate items.

LinkedHashSet:

It is used where we don't need duplication and we need to store the elements in order format. For example: When we are using dropdown for state names.
